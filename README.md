## Commands

All build commands realize two type of API:

- IUnityPreBuildCommand
- IUnityPostBuildCommand

You can create your own command with two ways: 

![](https://github.com/UniGameTeam/UniBuild/blob/master/GitAssets/commands1.png)

1. Unity ScriptableObject command

In that case inherit your SO from one of these classes - UnityPreBuildCommand, UnityPostBuildCommand

2. Serializable Regular C# class

If you choose this way, then just realise Interface API, no addition actions required
